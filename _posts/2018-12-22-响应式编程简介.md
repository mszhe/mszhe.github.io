# 什么是响应式编程
## From Wikipedia
    In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned 
    with data streams and the propagation of change.

- declarative programming 声明式编程
```java
public static void declarative(){
    int[] iArr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 };
    Arrays.stream(iArr).forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

- imperative programming 命令式编程
```java
public static void imperative() {
    int[] iArr = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 };
    for (int i = 0; i < iArr.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(iArr[i]);
    }
}
```

## From Spring WebFlux framework
    In plain terms reactive programming is about non-blocking applications that are asynchronous 
    and event-driven and require a small number of threads to scale vertically (i.e. within the JVM) 
    rather than horizontally (i.e. through clustering).

    A key aspect of reactive applications is the concept of backpressure which is a mechanism to 
    ensure producers don’t overwhelm consumers. For example in a pipeline of reactive components 
    extending from the database to the HTTP response when the HTTP connection is too slow the data 
    repository can also slow down or stop completely until network capacity frees up.

    Reactive programming also leads to a major shift from imperative to declarative async composition 
    of logic. It is comparable to writing blocking code vs using the CompletableFuture from Java 8 to 
    compose follow-up actions via lambda expressions.
